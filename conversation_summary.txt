The conversation is extremely brief and unclear.  The patient fails to adequately describe their ailment, stating only "I have" followed by what seems to be a misspelling or a word ("obliges") that doesn't provide medical context.  Therefore, no proper summary of the patient's disease can be given.

**Summary:**  The doctor initiated a consultation, but the patient failed to effectively communicate their medical issue.

**Recommendations:**

* **The patient needs to schedule a proper appointment:**  This fragmented conversation is insufficient for any diagnosis or treatment.  The patient must return for a full consultation, clearly and thoroughly describing their symptoms, medical history, and any relevant concerns.
* **The patient should prepare a list of symptoms:**  This will help ensure all relevant information is conveyed to the doctor.  Include onset, duration, frequency, severity, and any associated symptoms.
* **The patient should clarify "obliges":** If this was meant to be a symptom or description of a condition, the patient should correct the spelling or find a more accurate way to describe it.
* **The patient should consider bringing a friend or family member:** Having someone else present to help articulate concerns might be beneficial if communication is difficult.
* **The doctor needs to improve communication techniques:** While the patient's description is inadequate, the doctor's questions could be more open-ended and empathetic.  For example, instead of "what is your disease?",  a better approach would be "Can you tell me what's been bothering you?".


In short, this conversation highlights the importance of clear and comprehensive communication between doctor and patient for effective healthcare.
